		<h2>New school rap</h2>
		<p>The new school of hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. As with the hip hop preceding it which subsequently became known as old school hip hop, the new school came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine-led minimalism, with influences from rock music, a hip hop metal music for the 80s–a hard-edge ugly/beauty trance as desperate and stimulating as New York itself. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude.

These elements contrasted sharply with much of the previous funk- and disco-influenced hip hop groups, whose music was often characterized by novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers, and party rhymes not all artists prior to 1983–84 had these styles. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and they produced more cohesive LP albums than their old school counterparts. By 1986, their releases began to establish the hip-hop album as a fixture of mainstream music. Hip hop music became commercially successful, as exemplified by the Beastie Boys' 1986 album Licensed to Ill, which was the first rap album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts.</p>

		<h2>Hip hop</h2>
		<p>Hip hop's golden age or golden era is a name given to a period in mainstream hip hop, produced between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, which is characterized by its diversity, quality, innovation and influence. There were strong themes of Afrocentrism and political militancy in golden age hip hop lyrics. The music was experimental and the sampling drew on eclectic sources.There was often a strong jazz influence in the music. The artists and groups most often associated with this phase are Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, Eric B. and Rakim, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr, Big Daddy Kane and the Jungle Brothers.

The golden age is noted for its innovation, a time when it seemed that every new single reinvented the genre according to Rolling Stone. Referring to "hip-hop in its golden age Spin's editor-in-chief Sia Michel says, there were so many important, groundbreaking albums coming out right about that time, and MTV's Sway Calloway adds The thing that made that era so great is that nothing was contrived. Everything was still being discovered and everything was still innovative and new. Writer William Jelani Cobb says what made the era they inaugurated worthy of the term golden was the sheer number of stylistic innovations that came into existence in these golden years, a critical mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time.

The golden age spans from approximately 1986 to 1997.</p>
